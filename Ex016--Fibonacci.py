#Write a program that asks for a number n and prints the first n fibonacci numbers (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number). As an example, if n = 6 the program should print 1,1,2,3,5,8

#here I created a list to put every result of a and b
while i<=num:

 #First he prints 1 and the a value doesnÂ´t change
 #The append command is only used on lists and he adds a string value to a list

 #i increase by one everytime a value enters the list
 if i>=num:

#The "*" is used to output everything from the list spaced
#The sep command is used together with print to separate each value in a certain way
